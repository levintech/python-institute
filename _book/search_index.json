Essentials 1","keywords":"","body":"Welcome to Python Essentials 1\nThis course is the first in a 2-course series that will prepare you for the PCEP - Certified Entry-Level Python Programmer and PCAP: Certified Associate in Python Programming certification exams.\nThe main goal of the course is to guide you from a state of complete programming illiteracy to a level of programming knowledge which allows you to design, write, debug, and run programs encoded in the Python language, and to understand the basic concepts of software development technology.\nThe course will prepare you for jobs and careers connected with widely understood software development, which includes not only creating the code itself as a junior developer, but also computer systems design and software testing.\n"},"content/PE1/syllabus.html":{"url":"content/PE1/syllabus.html","title":"Syllabus","keywords":"","body":"Syllabus\nIn this course you will learn:\n\nthe universal concepts of computer programming;\nthe syntax and semantics of the Python language;\npractical skills in resolving typical implementation challenges;\nhow to use the most important elements of the Python Standard Library;\nhow to install your runtime environment;\nhow to design, write, test, and debug your own Python programs.\n\nThe course is divide into 4 modules:\n\nModule 1\n Introduction to Python and computer programming;\nModule 2\n Data types, variables, basic input-output operations, and basic operators;\nModule 3\n Boolean values, conditional execution, loops, lists and list processing, logical and bitwise operations;\nModule 4\n Functions, tuples, dictionaries, and data processing.\n\nWhy should you learn PYTHON?\nPython is omnipresent, and many people use numerous Python-powered devices on a daily basis, whether they realize it or not. There have been millions (well, actually billions) of lines of code written in Python, which means almost unlimited opportunities for code reuse and learning from well-crafted examples. What's more, there is a large and very active Python community, always happy to help.\nThere are also a couple of factors that make Python great for learning:\n\nIt is easy to learn - the time needed to learn Python is shorter than for many other languages; this means that it's possible to start the actual programming faster;\nIt is easy to use for writing new software - it's often possible to write code faster when using Python;\nIt is easy to obtain, install and deploy - Python is free, open and multiplatform; not all languages can boast that.\n\nCompleting this course can be a stepping-stone to learning any other programming language, and to exploring technologies using Python as a foundation (e.g., Django). The course is distinguished by its affordability, friendliness, and openness to the student.\nThe first part starts from the absolute basics, guiding you step-by-step to complex problems explained in part 2, making you a responsible software creator able to take on different challenges in many positions in the IT industry.\n"},"content/PE1/application-for-python.html":{"url":"content/PE1/application-for-python.html","title":"Applications for Python","keywords":"","body":"Where do you use Python?\nAll the games use Python for logic and server controls.

Dropbox? UBER? Spotify? Pintrest? BuzzFeed? Yes. They were all written, to a greater or lesser extent, in Python.

Without a program, a computer, even the most powerful one, is nothing more than an object. Similarly, without a player, a piano is nothing more than a wooden box.\nComputers are able to perform very complex tasks, but this ability is not innate. A computer's nature is quite different.\nIt can execute only extremely simple operations. For example, a computer cannot understnad the value of compicated mathematical function by itself, although this isn't beyond the realms of possibility in the near future.\nContemporary computers can only evaluate the results of very fundamental operations, like adding or dividing, but they can do it very fast, and can repeat these actions virtually any number of times.\nImagine that you want to know the average speed you've reached during a long journey. You know the distance, you know the time, you need the speed.\nNaturally, the computer will be able to compute this, but the computer is not aware of such things as distance, speed, or time. Therefore, it is necessary to instruct the computer to:\n\naccept a number representing the distance\naccept a number representing the travel time\ndivide the former value by a latter and store the result in the memory\ndisplay the result (representing the average speed) in a readable format.\n\nThese four simple actions form a program. Of course, these examples are not formalized, and they are very far from what the computer can understand, but they are good enough to be translated into a language the computer can accept.\nLanguage is the keyword.\n"},"content/PE1/Module1/natural-languages-vs-programming-languages.html":{"url":"content/PE1/Module1/natural-languages-vs-programming-languages.html","title":"Natural Languages vs. Programming Languages","keywords":"","body":"Natural languages vs. programming languages\nA language is a means (and a tool) for expressing and recording thoughts. There are many languages all around us. Some of them require neither speaking nor writing, such as body language; it's possible to express your deepest feelings very precisely without saying a word.\nAnother language you use each day is your mother tongue, which you use to manifest your will and to ponder reality. Computers have their own language, too, called machine language, which is very rudimentary.\nA computer, even the most technically sophisticated, is devoid of even a trace of intelligence. You could say that it is like a well-trained dog - it responds only to a predetermined set of known commands.\nThe commands it recognizes are very simple. We can imagine that the computer responds to orders like \"take that number, divide by another and save the result\".\nA complete set of known commands is called an instruction list, sometimes abbreviated to IL. Different types of computers may vary depending on the size of their ILs, and the instructions could be completely different in different models.\nNote: machine languages are developed by humans.\nNo computer is currently capable of creating a new language. However, that may change soon. Just as people use a number of very different languages, machines have many different languages, too. The difference, though, is that human languages developed naturally.\nMoreover, they are still evolving, and new words are created every day as old words disappear. These languages are called natural languages.\n"}}}
